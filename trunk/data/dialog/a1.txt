s|p|I'm here, can you hear me?

i|janitor
s|j|What? Oh, it's you, sunshine.
s|j|Get cracking.

i|protagonist
s|p|I see some papers already, but...
p|30
s|p|um...
p|30
s|p|there's something in front of the door.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|What?
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|It's sort of a green glowing blob-thing.
s|p|It doesn't look natural. Or healthy.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|That would be radioactive waste, kid, so
s|j|healthy isn't exactly what I'd call it.
c
s|j|And it isn't wallpaper paste, so try not
s|j|to eat it. Got the spray I gave you?
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|Yeah...
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Walk right up to the green spot, holding
s|j|the can in front of you. Give it a good
s|j|shake and press the spacebar.
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|The what?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|I said press the lever on top of the can.
s|j|And whatever you do, don't get the
s|j|radiation on you.
c
s|j|Mutant hunting is a big pain in my
s|j|backside.
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|Um. Okay, definitely not going to touch
s|p|the green stuff.
