s|s|Unfortunately, his lab is, shall we say,

s|s|I can not stress enough how vitally

s|s|important his work is!
c

s|p|Hazardous materials?
cc
i|supervisor
snd|talktalk.wav
s|s|Oh, they're really only mildly

s|s|hazardous; probably won't cause many
s|s|mutations.
c
snd|talktalk.wav
s|s|Incidentally, you'll need to sign this

s|s|waiver first. Also, I'd like to mention
