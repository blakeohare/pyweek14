s|s|Hey, how's it going?
s|s|You've been with us for...
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|Two months.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Two months, now. That's quite a while
s|s|and I think you've done well, Miss, uh...
c
s|s|...yes, very well!
cc
s|s|To show how much we appreciate your
s|s|hard work, I'd like to give you a 
s|s|very crucial assignment because you're-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Expendable.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|-extremely talented!
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|Um, thanks, I guess. What is this
s|p|assignment?
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Well, Dr. Flügenmeister has, uh, gone
s|s|on an unannounced leave of absence-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Disappeared.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Leaving his research notes behind.
cc
s|s|Unfortunately, his lab is, shall we say,
p|60
s|s|"cluttered".
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Seen rats in there that walk like men.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Recently, he made a very important, 
s|s|even critical, discovery.
c
s|s|I can not stress enough how vitally
s|s|important his work is, not only to our
s|s|company, but to mankind!
c
s|s|We must retrieve this research at all
s|s|costs; fortunately, we have you.
c
s|s|Your records indicate that you're
s|s|extremely talented, intelligent,
s|s|dedicated-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Desperate.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|You'll do a superb job! Now, there might
s|s|be some slightly hazardous materials 
s|s|in the lab...

s|w|spraycan.
cc
i|protagonist-nervous
s|p|Hazardous materials?
p|40
s|p|Like what?
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Oh, they're really only mildly
s|s|hazardous; probably won't cause any
s|s|mutations at all.
c
s|s|Incidentally, you'll need to sign this
s|s|waiver first. Also, I'd like to mention
s|s|that, if you do succeed, I believe I can
c
s|s|get you that letter of recommendation
s|s|you need-
cc
i|protagonist-exclaim
s|p|I'll do it!
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Excellent! You'll be escorted to the
s|s|entrance to his lab shortly.
c
s|s|It's a large space, so be sure to look
s|s|everywhere. Remember, we need that
s|s|research!

s|j|This way you can keep me posted about

p|60
s|p|Why?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|So I don't have to look too hard for
s|j|your body.
