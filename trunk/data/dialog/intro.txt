i|supervisor
s|s|Two months, now. That's quite a while
s|s|and I think you've done well, Miss, uh...
c
s|s|...yes, very well!
cc
s|s|To show how much we appreciate your
s|s|hard work, I’d like to give you a 
s|s|very crucial assignment because you’re-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Expendable.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|-extremely talented!
cc
i|protagonist
s|p|Um, thanks, I guess. What is this
s|p|assignment?
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Well, Dr. Flügenmeister has, uh, gone
s|s|on an unannounced leave of absence-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Disappeared.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Leaving his research notes behind.
cc
s|s|Unfortunately, his lab is, shall we say,
p|30
s|s|cluttered.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Seen rats in there that walk like men.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Recently, he made a very important, 
s|s|even critical, discovery.
c
s|s|I can not stress enough how vitally
s|s|important his work is, not only to our
s|s|company, but to mankind!
c
s|s|We must retrieve this research at all
s|s|costs; fortunately, we have you.
c
s|s|Your records indicate that you’re
s|s|extremely talented, intelligent,
s|s|dedicated-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Desperate.

Supervisor: You’ll do a superb job! Now, there might be some slightly hazardous materials in the lab...
*Janitor hands the Intern a can of ACME All-Purpose Radiation Decontaminant*
Janitor: You’re going to need this, sunshine.
Intern: Hazardous materials?Like what?
Supervisor: Oh, they’re really only mildly hazardous; probably won’t cause any mutations at all. Incidentally, you’ll need to sign this waiver first. Also, I’d like to mention that, if you do succeed, I believe I can get you that letter of recommendation you need-
