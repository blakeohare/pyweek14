s|p|No thanks to you! I'm in
s|p|Room B-1, and there's another
s|p|weird spot on the floor, and a 
s|p|big blue block to match.

s|j|Security measure, guard against
s|j|killer sloth men. Strong but lazy,
s|j|they'd wear themselves out thinking about
s|j|the block and go to sleep.

s|j|Anyway, just push the block on the button to
s|j|open the door.

s|p|are there?

s|j|Naw.
