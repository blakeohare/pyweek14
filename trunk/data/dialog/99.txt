s|p|You're normal again!

i|flugenmeister-before
s|f|Never better, thanks to you!
s|f|Too much radiation,
s|f|I suspect. Unfortunate.
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|Great, so you can finish

s|j|****static***
s|j|Hey, sunshine, haven't heard
s|j|status in a while. Find anything?
cc
i|protagonist-sad
s|p|I found Dr. Flügenmeister.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Good job.
cc
i|protagonist-sarcastic
s|p|He says he's going to abandon his
s|p|research and study the rats instead.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Better bring back the research, then.
s|j|Use the backdoor to get here faster.
cc
i|protagonist-exclaim
s|p|Backdoor? You mean this whole time-
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Think of it this way, kid:
s|j|you're not the same person who walked in
s|j|to this place this morning, am I right?
cc
i|protagonist-hmm
s|p|Maybe...
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Listen, kid, I was thinking: 
s|j|you didn't do too bad today.
c
s|j|Want to come work for me?
s|j|Pay is great, better than what the
s|j|paperpushers here make.
cc
i|protagonist-sarcastic
s|p|You mean facing death constantly in
s|p|crazy situations with impossible goals?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Sure, but
c
s|j|I was thinking you'd start vacuuming.
cc
i|protagonist-pout
s|p|Oh.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|'Course some of the carpets are portals to
s|j|other dimensions, especially shag. I keep
s|j|telling them not to order shag...
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|I'll do it!
cc
i|janitor
s|j|That's what I thought, sunshine.
s|j|Now we're going to talk about salary
s|j|and benefits.
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|Do I get a hover jet now?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|No.
cc
i|protagonist-pout
s|p|Aww.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Maybe after your first evaluation.
