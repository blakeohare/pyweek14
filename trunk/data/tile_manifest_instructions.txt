# Lines that begin with # are comments.

# If you are editing this file, please make sure that your name is Spears before continuing. 
#
# Each file will show up as a different tile category in the map editor listing all the tiles
# that reside in that file. 
#
# Do not duplicate tiles across files.
#
# Format is as follows...
#
# This file is a table. Each line is a row. Each tab-delimited thing is a column
#
# The first column is the tile ID. 
#     This is may consiste of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes. Anything
#     else will blow up the world.
#     The actual ID doesn't really matter that much. No one will see it.
#
# The second column is the images for the tile
#     For un-animated tiles, this is just a filename
#     For animated tiles, this is a number followed by a list of filenames
#       The number is the number of frames between each animation
#       The number can be omitted and 4 will be assumed
#     Each filename is the path under images/tiles/
#     Each item in this list is delimited with a | character
#     Examples:
#        bricks.png
#        shiny_bricks1.png|shiny_bricks2.png|shiny_bricks3.png
#        2|glowing_block1.png|glowing_block2.png
#
# The third column is the height of the tile.
#     This is just a number.
#     A tile shaped like a cube has a height of 2
#
# The fourth column is a list of properties. This is just a list of characters codes.
#     Each character code is one ascii character that means something
#     The order you list them doesn't matter.
#     I will add more properties to this list as they become necessary
#     x - blocking
#     s - sliding block
#     c - circuit
#     1 - stairs that go up NW
#     2 - stairs that go up NE
#     3 - stairs that go up SW
#     4 - stairs that go up SE
#     c - contamination present
#     g - use for the tile in front of the goal
#     h - capable of holding a charge
#
# I may add something as a 5th column if it becomes necessary
