s|j|Disappeared.
cc
i|supervisor
snd|talktalk
s|s|Leaving his research notes behind.

snd|talktalk
s|s|Unfortunately, his lab is, shall we say,
p|60
snd|talk
s|s|cluttered.

s|s|I can not stress enough how vitally
snd|talktalk
s|s|important his work is!
c

snd|talk
s|s|in the lab...

cc

snd|talktalk
s|s|Oh, they're really only mildly

s|s|hazardous; probably won't cause many
s|s|mutations.
c
snd|talktalk
s|s|Incidentally, you'll need to sign this
