s|p|You have no idea what I had to go through
s|p|to get these.

s|w|Handed over research.
#if there are less than 15 papers
i|supervisor
s|s|This...is barely adequate.
s|s|Did you even try?
cc
i|protagonist-wtf
s|p|There were rats! And coils! And-
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Never mind, allowances must be made
s|s|for your youth and inexperience.
c
s|s|I hope your work improves in the future.
cc
#if there are less than 30 papers but more than 15
i|supervisor
s|s|It appears you retrieved the bulk of the
s|s|research, though not all of it.
cc
i|protagonist-wtf
s|p|I had to go through radioactive waste,
s|p|mutant rats, and a lab that was trying
s|p|to kill me! I think I did okay!
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|I'm sure you do. Don't worry;
s|s|even if the result was mediocre,
s|s|we will make allowances considering your
s|s|rather temporary position here.
c
s|s|Perhaps in the future, you'll be able to do
s|s|some real quality work!

s|s|Did...did you get Dr. Flügenmeister’s
s|s|grocery list in here too?
cc
i|protagonist-smirk
s|p|Is that what that was?
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|It's written in Esperanto,
s|s|or maybe Klingon.
c
s|s|Anyway, I suppose this is an...
c
s|s|acceptable job. I mean,
s|s|did you bring back a specimen?
cc
i|protagonist-exclaim
s|p|You mean one of the giant killer rats?
c
i|protagonist-sarcastic
s|p|No, I didn't bring one of those back.
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Shame. I suppose it's too much to expect
s|s|someone so young and green to go above and
s|s|beyond mere necessity.
cc
#Dialogue continues normally from here.
i|supervisor
s|s|In any case, we can continue
s|s|Dr. Flügenmeister’s work now!
c
s|s|A gas-powered can opener...
c
s|s|What a visionary.
cc
i|protagonist-wtf
s|p|WHAT? You mean all this work-
cc
i|supervisor
s|s|Speaking of work, I suggest you get back to yours!
s|s|Just think: if you do well enough,
s|s|one day you could be like me!

s|j|Hey sunshine.
cc

s|p|Hey! I made it!
cc
i|janitor
s|j|I can see that. Listen, kid,
s|j|I was thinking: you didn't do
s|j|too bad in there today.
c
s|j|Want to come work for me?
s|j|Pay is great, better than what the
s|j|paperpushers here make.
cc
i|protagonist-sarcastic
s|p|You mean facing death constantly in
s|p|crazy situations with impossible goals?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|I was thinking you'd start on the floors.
cc
i|protagonist-pout
s|p|Oh.
i|janitor
s|j|'Course some of the carpets are portals to
s|j|other dimensions, especially shag. I keep
s|j|telling them not to order shag...
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|I'll do it.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|That's what I thought, sunshine.
s|j|Now we're going to talk about salary
s|j|and benefits.
cc
i|protagonist-happy
s|p|Do I get a hover jet now?
cc
i|janitor
s|j|No.
cc
i|protagonist-pout
s|p|Aww.
cc
i|janitor
s|j|Maybe after your first evaluation.
